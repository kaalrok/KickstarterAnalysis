# Kickstarting with Excel
An analysis of kickstarter campaigns
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the best time of year and the best funding goal to kick start a play fund.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges that arose in this analysis came from calculating the Outcomes based on goals. The formulas were a bit more than I expected. But the analysis that came from these outcomes were definitely worth the time spent. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The launch dates between May and September have the highest success rates, while starting a kick-starter in the winter months have the lowest. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

There were no canceled kick starters in the category of “plays”. As the goals rise above $15,000, the failures are more likely to happen. Though between $30,000 and $40,000, the successes outweighed the failures 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
If you are interested in starting a fund raiser based on plays, the summer months have the highest chance of success. 
If you really want to do a winter play, try doing it in the South.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful outcomes came from goals that were below $5000. 
The riskiest outcomes came from goals between $25,000 and $35000, though anything above $$45,000 is extremely risky.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There were no cancelations in the plays category. While that helped this category, it was not a good representation of the rest of the data.
 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would be interested in a graph that showed the dollar amount of the kickstarter successes vs failures depending on the time of the year.
